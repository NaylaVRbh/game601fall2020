        Column Combat is a 2-player gambling guessing game played with a total of 10 cards:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker. Players are assigned a ‘column’ of either even number cards or non-number cards. After betting an equal amount of money, each player must guess a combination of 3, 4, or up to 5 cards in order before revealing their column. The number of cards guessed and whether the card sequence is correct or not determines the wins and losses of money.

        ABI is a narrative game created using inform 7. The word abi is an ancient Akkadian word that translates to my father.
The narrative game takes place in ancient Mesopotamia. The player’s objective is to fulfill the wishes of their father of being buried on the island which is often described by the elders to be paradise on Earth. The island is inspired by the land of ancient Dilmun and its descriptions within the game are from ancient cuneiform tablets.
The player begins the game by arriving at a port of the island of Awal (another name for the land of Dilmun), carrying the body of their father who has passed. The player is guided to prepare for burial rituals. In order to succeed in burying their father, the player must complete the preparation of the burial rituals on the island as so to unlock the doors of the Temple Graveyard. The Graveyard will have several doors and guards to ensure the player has the correct items (keys) in order to enter. The player may not enter the Temple Graveyard without completing the preparation.
Preparation for burial includes tasks of varying difficulties:
+  Locating the site of the purest spring on the island
+  Obtaining the White Burial Garment
+  Obtaining muhru (an offering for the Gods)
+  Obtaining a text of dalilu (prayer to the Gods)
